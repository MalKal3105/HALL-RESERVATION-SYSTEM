# HALL-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
This is a web-based system developed during my Diploma Semester 3 as part of a major academic project. The system allows users to reserve halls, check availability, and manage bookings through an interactive interface. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for the front end and PHP with MySQL on the back end.
